            I'm Sophi Dickens. I'm using this site as a little development project to get familiarized with html and css. I'm starting a bootcamp soon for programming, and am hoping to leap forward into a job in the devolpment field shortly after.
            <br>
            I enjoy:
            <ul>
                <li>Playing hockey</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Playing and building video games</li>
            </ul>
